var sqlQuery = @"SELECT DISTINCT S.MovieId
FROM Show AS S
INNER JOIN Movie as M
ON M.Id = S.MovieId
WHERE M.Name = @MovieName";
return _db.Query<Show>(sqlQuery, new { @MovieName = showNames.MovieNames }).ToList();

Instead of returning, I want to save the fetched output in a variable, here showNames is an object of model ShowNames which has properties (all strings: Show, MovieName, TheatreName), 
I think we are using dapper here.

=========================================

var sqlQuery = @"SELECT DISTINCT S.MovieId
FROM Show AS S
INNER JOIN Movie as M
ON M.Id = S.MovieId
WHERE M.Name = @MovieName";

// Execute the query and save the result in a variable
var movieIds = _db.Query<int>(sqlQuery, new { @MovieName = showNames.MovieName }).ToList();

// Now you can use the movieIds variable as needed
